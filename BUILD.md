## Build Prerequisites

This package requires the following:
- OpenSSL 3.0.7+ libraries and development headers
- OpenSSL tools (for testing)
- NSS softoken, tools and development headers (for testing)
- a C compiler that supports at least C11 semantics
- meson
- pkg-config
- p11-kit, p11-kit-server, p11-kit-devel, opensc and softhsm (for testing)

The usual command to build are:
- meson setup builddir
- meson compile -C builddir
- meson test -C builddir

To link with OpenSSL installed in a custom path, set
`PKG_CONFIG_PATH`, or `CFLAGS`/`LDFLAGS` envvars accordingly at the
`meson setup` step. For example, let's assume OpenSSL is installed
under an absolute path `$OPENSSL_DIR`.

If you rely on pkg-config, point `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` to a directory
where `libcrypto.pc` or `openssl.pc` can be found.

- `PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$OPENSSL_DIR/lib64/pkg-config" meson setup builddir`

Otherwise, you can set `CFLAGS`/`LDFLAGS`:

- `CFLAGS="-I$OPENSSL_DIR/include" LDFLAGS="-L$OPENSSL_DIR/lib64" meson setup builddir`
